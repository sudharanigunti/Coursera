Topic 1: 
#PyTorch supports two different types of datasets: map-style datasets, iterable-style datasets.

# Three general characteristics of Data Sets namely: Dimensionality, Sparsity, and Resolution.
# Dimensionality: number of attributes that the objects in the data set have
# Sparsity: most attributes of an object have values of 0; in many cases fewer than 1% of the entries are non-zero
# Resolution: The patterns in the data depend on the level of resolution. If the resolution is too fine, a pattern may not be visible or may be buried in noise; if the resolution is too coarse, the pattern may disappear
# Curse of Dimensionality : Data Analysis becomes difficult as the dimensionality of the data set increases


# 3 types of datsets: Record Data, Graph-based Data, and Ordered Data
# Record Data = Data matrix, Document Term matrix, transaction data, records of data
# Graph-based Data = Linked Webpages, Beneze molecule
# Ordered Data = Sequqntial transaction data, Temperature time series, Spatial temperature data, Genomin Sequence data
