Multi-Label classification:
It can be solved in 3 ways - 
      1. Problem Transformation: In this you transform Multi Label into Single Label problem. By using anyone among 3 methods i.e Binary Relevance, Classifeir chains, Labels Powerset.
      2. Adapted Algorithm: 
      3. Ensemble Approaches:

Ex:
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
model = OneVsRestClassifier(RandomForestClassifier())
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

y_train = Class_1 Class_2 Class_3
            0        1       0
            0        0       1
            1        1       1
            1        0       0
            1        1       1
            1        0       0
